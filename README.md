# Extracting-Elevation-Along-a-Cross-Section-Using-Google-Earth-Engine
This script extracts elevation values along a defined cross-section using Google Earth Engine (GEE). A line segment is drawn, and sample points are placed along it at equal intervals. The script then retrieves elevation values at each of these locations using the CGIAR SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
